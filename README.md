# Arduino Leonardo Mouse Jiggler

Does what it says on the tin! Upload to an Arduino Leonardo (or compatible) board, plug into the target machine, and it will make a tiny mouse movement and click the mouse approximately every 5 minutes, which should be enough to remain active in an application that checks for inactivity and bases status based on that, such as for example, slack. 

I am not responsible if this gets you fired for any reason, including due to some clever EDR checking for "Arduino" strings in kernel logs as the USB device connects - so use this at your own risk! Kthx
